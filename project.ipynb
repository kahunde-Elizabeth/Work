    "## 1. Merge Sort\n",
    "Merge Sort is a **divide and conquer** algorithm that recursively splits an array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. If the array has more than one element, it is split into two halves (left and right).\n",
    "2. Recursively apply Merge Sort to both halves.\n",
    "3. Merge the two sorted halves back together by comparing elements one by one.\n",
    "4. Continue merging until the entire array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **Best, Worst, and Average Case:** \\( O(n \\log n) \\)\n",
    "- **Why?**\n",
    "  - The array is recursively divided in half \\( (\\log n) \\).\n",
    "  - Merging takes \\( O(n) \\) time per level.\n",
    "  - So, total time complexity = \\( O(n \\log n) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **O(n)** (Extra space is needed to store the left and right halves of the array during merging.)\n"

    "## Radix Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "**Radix Sort** is a **non-comparative sorting algorithm** that sorts numbers (or strings) digit by digit, from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD). It is particularly useful for sorting large datasets of numbers or strings of fixed length.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Find the Maximum Number**: \n",
    "   - Start by determining the maximum number in the list to determine how many digits need to be processed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Sort by Each Digit**:\n",
    "   - Sort the numbers starting from the **least significant digit** (LSD), then move to the next significant digit (tens, hundreds, etc.), and so on.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Use Counting Sort as a Subroutine**:\n",
    "   - For each digit, use **Counting Sort** (a stable sorting algorithm) to sort the numbers based on that particular digit. Counting Sort is applied to each digit individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat for All Digits**:\n",
    "   - Continue the process until all digits have been processed (i.e., until the most significant digit is reached).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you have a list of numbers: `[170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Step 1**: Sort by the least significant digit (units place): \n",
    "  - `[170, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 90, 66]`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Step 2**: Sort by the next digit (tens place): \n",
    "  - `[802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90]`\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Step 3**: Sort by the most significant digit (hundreds place):\n",
    "  - `[2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]`\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the final sorted list is `[2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **Best, Worst, and Average Case:** \\( O(nk) \\), where:\n",
    "  - \\( n \\) = number of elements in the array.\n",
    "  - \\( k \\) = number of digits in the largest number.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Why?**\n",
    "  - Counting Sort runs in \\( O(n) \\) for each digit.\n",
    "  - There are \\( O(k) \\) digits to process in the largest number.\n",
    "  - Therefore, the total time complexity is \\( O(nk) \\).\n",

    "## Multi-Key Sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Key Sorting** is a technique used when sorting elements based on more than one attribute or key. For example, you may want to sort a list of employees **first by department**, and then **by salary** within each department. This ensures that employees within the same department are ranked by their salary while maintaining the primary sorting order by department.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Custom Sorting Function**: \n",
    "   - Use a sorting function that can handle multiple keys. In Python, this can be done using the built-in `sorted()` function with a custom `key`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Sort by Primary Key First**:\n",
    "   - The first key is used to sort the elements (e.g., department).\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Sort by Secondary Key**:\n",
    "   - If two elements have the same value for the first key, the second key is used for sorting (e.g., salary).\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Stable Sorting**:\n",
    "   - The sorting should be **stable**, meaning that the order of elements with equal keys should remain the same as before sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- its useful when sorting complex data structures(ie, students by grade then name, employes by department then salary)\n",
    "- ie \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-key sorting is essential in real-world applications like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Databases (sorting users by region → activity)\n",

    "- HR Systems (sorting employees by department → salary)\n",

    "Jump Search: The time complexity is O(√n), which is slower than Binary Search but still significantly faster than Linear Search (O(n)) in certain cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best For:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search: It is best suited for large datasets that support random access, such as arrays or databases, where you can quickly access any element by its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jump Search: It is best for large datasets where random access is possible but more efficient than linear search. Jump Search is particularly useful when a full linear scan would be too slow, and it doesn’t require the overhead of keeping track of midpoints in an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search: Commonly used in situations where you need to find an element or insert an element into a sorted list efficiently. For example, it’s used in searching algorithms, database indexing, and file systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jump Search: Used in cases where large, sorted datasets are involved, and it’s beneficial to reduce the number of comparisons by skipping through elements. It can be used in applications where speed is critical and linear search is too slow.\n",

    "Optimized For:\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search:\n",

    "Significance of Recursion in Divide-and-Conquer\n",
    "Recursion’s role in divide-and-conquer isn’t just a coding convenience—it’s fundamental to the paradigm’s power. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Natural Problem Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Many problems (e.g., sorting, searching, matrix multiplication) have a recursive structure where the solution depends on smaller instances of the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion mirrors this structure, making the algorithm design intuitive. For example, in Merge Sort, splitting an array into halves feels natural as a recursive step.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Efficiency Through Divide-and-Conquer\n",
    "Recursion enables logarithmic or near-linear time complexities by reducing problem size exponentially:\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge Sort: O(n log n) — halves the array (log n levels), merges linearly (n work per level).\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Search: O(log n) — halves the search space each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Sort: O(n log n) average case — partitions reduce subproblem sizes unevenly but effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without recursion, achieving this efficiency would require manual stack management, obscuring the algorithm’s elegance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Backtracking and Exploration\n",
    "In some divide-and-conquer problems (like the maze solver we discussed), recursion explores multiple paths and backtracks naturally via the call stack. This is a form of divide-and-conquer where subproblems are possible moves, and recursion conquers by finding a valid path.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplified Code and Correctness\n",
    "Recursion reduces complex iterative bookkeeping (e.g., maintaining multiple loops or stacks) into a single function that calls itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case ensures termination, and the recursive case handles the divide-and-combine logic, making proofs of correctness (e.g., via induction) straightforward."
